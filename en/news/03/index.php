                <p>IDC has revised its forecast for the growth of IT spending in the business sector. The results are unexpected<br>Global spending on IT and business services in the corporate segment will grow by 5.7% this year despite the difficult macroeconomic situation and the impending recession, IDC calculated. Growth for 2023 is projected at 5.2%. If we subtract the impact of inflation on the dollar, then the growth of the IT market in the business segment will be 2% in 2022.</p>
                <p>Moreover, some time ago, the forecast for the annual growth of this market segment for a five-year period was revised upward by IDC specialists: instead of 4.9%, the growth will be 5.2% annually starting from 2023.</p>
                <p>But the growth rate of global GDP is slowing down: this year it is expected to grow at the level of 2.7%, and in 2023 only 2.4%.</p>

            <div class="text_block text_ffMont">
                <p>But this does not prevent some vendors from flourishing: IDC reports that in the first half of 2022, the median growth of the 20 largest companies operating in the corporate IT market was about 9% (excluding companies providing engineering services).</p>
                <p>However, positive news may face one major threat: the wings of a growing business market may be undercut by suppliers and difficulties with supply chains. But the IT consulting market is not in danger, it does not depend much on suppliers: IDC predicts this segment to grow by 6-8% annually in the coming years.</p>
                <p>Applications are one of the locomotives of the market: during the pandemic, many users who previously preferred offline services and stores turned to the digital market. Application development and support is fueling the IT services market in the corporate segment: this sector, as IDC expects, will grow by 4.5-5.2% annually in the next five years.</p>
                <p>As for the geographical aspect, IDC experts have revised their previous forecasts due to the political situation in the world that changed six months ago. Thus, the forecast has not changed for Canada, it has improved for Latin America, and for the USA, the forecast of growth of the market of IT products and services for business for the near future has decreased from 6.2% to 5.1%. The forecast for the Asia-Pacific region has also worsened: now growth in the above segment is expected to reach 5.5% annually.</p>
                <p>For China, the forecast is also worsened against the background of economic problems in this country: now IT is projected to increase IT spending in the business segment at the level of 6.4% per year for the coming period. India is holding up noticeably better, but the forecast there has also been revised downwards — from 8.9% to 8.2%. In Australia and New Zealand, the forecast is improved.</p>
                <p>The forecast of the growth of the market of IT products and services for business in the Middle East and Africa (MEA region) is also quite positive: at the level of 6-8%, recent political events have not had much impact on the forecast of IDC in this region.</p>
                <p>In Europe, everything is expected to be difficult. The forecast for Central and Eastern Europe is still in the black, at 3.6%, but the situation there is getting worse. But in Western Europe, very steady growth is expected at the level of 7% per year for 2022 and 5.5-6% for the next coming years. And this is against the background of a sharp increase in electricity and energy prices in the region. Nevertheless, IDC does not see a risk for the IT market in the business segment in Western Europe and has improved the forecast for France, Germany, the Scandinavian countries and the UK.</p>
                <p>By the way, in Europe, one of the engines of growth is the noticeably increased military spending. In addition, a strong trend towards digitalization is noticeable in European organizations; there is also a massive transition to the clouds.</p>
