                <p>Bad news for night sky lovers. In a recent study, scientists found out that space advertising is not only possible today, but also economically profitable under certain conditions. Their work is published in the journal Aerospace. Will advertising appear in space soon? Although advertising is ubiquitous on our planet, its orbit remains intact... But for how long?</p>
                <p>Several companies are already working on this, for example, the Russian startup StartRocket. The company's ambitions are to be able to launch small cubesats into a low orbit (400-500 km) in order to create a giant programmable display panel measuring fifty square meters. More recently, a team from Skoltech and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology wanted to check whether the technology is really feasible and whether it is economically feasible for advertisers to rent such displays.</p>
                <p>"We have been studying some technical aspects of space advertising for some time," Shamil Biktimirov from Skoltech said in a statement. "This time we have considered the economic side of the matter and, no matter how unrealistic it may seem, we show that space advertising based on fifty or more small satellites flying in formation can be economically profitable." The team considered the technical side of such a project. Then they found that a solar sail with an area of 32 square meters (the largest reflector successfully installed on a CubeSat to date) can successfully broadcast an image in pixels. Flying in formation, these small satellites can create an image visible from the ground</p>

                <p>Finally, the researchers naturally raised the main objection to such projects, namely the problem of light pollution, which can interfere with astronomical observations. The team says that because of the proposed orbit, advertising can only be shown at sunrise or sunset so that it does not interfere with telescopes. In addition, advertising will be highlighted only in densely populated areas</p>
                <p>According to the researchers, the best way to establish the economic feasibility of such a system would be to hold demonstrations in megacities. In their opinion, there is usually constant light pollution in cities, so they are not considered places of observatories where space advertising can cause harm. Finally, it should be remembered that no system has been tested yet. There is also no indication that such an approach can be approved in accordance with local and international laws and regulations.</p>
