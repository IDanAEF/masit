            <div class="text_block text_ffMont">
                <p>The saying “you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink” is especially relevant when advertising products to customers on the Internet, especially to those who are not really looking for them. No visibility or advertising money can guarantee conversion if there is no intention to buy.</p>
                <p>This is a serious problem when it comes to stimulating digital marketing campaigns. Since several ads, in fact, advertise to the wrong audience, this problem often leads to waste (or non-optimization) of advertising money. Google is one of the leading players in the field of online advertising, and its Google Ads (formerly AdWords) platform is in the lead.</p>
                <p>The tech giant knows something about advertising and has data confirming it. Fortunately, Google always strives to improve the effectiveness of its advertising tools and campaigns using this valuable information. One of its additions is the Google custom intent audiences feature, which maximizes conversions by using search intent data.</p>

                What is the key<br>functionality of Google<br>Custom Intent Audiences?

            <div class="text_block text_ffMont">
                <p>Google Intent user audiences are configured for Google Ads, YouTube, and the Google Display network. This feature helps advertisers target the audience that buys on the market. Instead of focusing on the general interests and demographics of users (a shot in the dark), it gets even better.</p>
                <p>Google custom intent audiences advertisements are aimed at those who are currently searching for certain products or services on the Internet. Adding relevant keywords, competitor URLs, and even competitor apps to Google's user audiences helps advertisers attract the right customers, not just ordinary Internet users.</p>

            <h3 class="text text_fz24 text_white text_ffMont">
                User audiences of Google's intentions are typically optimized using:
            </h3>
            <div class="dash_block text_fz16 text_ffMont">
                <span class="text_fw600">Keywords to search for.</span> Keywords internet users are looking for for online help. When customers enter keywords such as “homemade gerbil for sale” or “the best plumber next to me”, it is likely that they want to purchase these goods or services. Advertisers can use similar keywords in custom Google Apps target audiences to target such audiences.
            </div>
            <div class="dash_block text_fz16 text_ffMont">
                <span class="text_fw600">Browsing activity.</span> Browsing patterns of specific Internet users are another indicator of the intention to make a purchase. When Internet users visit a competitor's website, it is likely that they are researching or buying products or services similar to yours. Advertisers can enter competitor URLs into Google's user intent audiences to attract competitor customers.
